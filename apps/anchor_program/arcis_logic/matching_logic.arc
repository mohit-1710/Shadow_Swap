/**
 * ShadowSwap MPC Matching Logic
 * 
 * This file will contain the Arcis MPC (Multi-Party Computation) logic
 * for privacy-preserving order matching.
 * 
 * The matching engine will:
 * 1. Receive encrypted orders from multiple parties
 * 2. Perform order matching without revealing individual order details
 * 3. Output matched trade pairs and settlement instructions
 * 4. Preserve privacy throughout the matching process
 * 
 * TODO: Implement Arcis MPC protocol for:
 * - Encrypted order comparison
 * - Price-time priority matching
 * - Privacy-preserving settlement amounts
 */

// Placeholder for future MPC matching logic implementation
// This will integrate with the Arcis framework for secure computation
