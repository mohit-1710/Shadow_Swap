### 4️⃣ **Additional Security Tests**

#### Test 4.1: Complex Multi-User Scenario ✅
```typescript
Scenario: Multiple users place/cancel orders concurrently
Expected: All operations succeed, state remains consistent
Verifies: System stability under load
```

---

## 🏗️ **Test Architecture**

### Setup Phase
```typescript
before(async () => {
  ✓ Create test keypairs (User A, User B, Keeper)
  ✓ Airdrop SOL to all accounts
  ✓ Create WSOL and USDC token mints
  ✓ Create and fund token accounts
  ✓ Initialize order book (SOL/USDC)
  ✓ Create callback auth for keeper
})
```

### Test Data Generation
```typescript
// Simulated encrypted data (mimics frontend encryption)
createDummyCipherPayload(256)  // 256 random bytes
createDummyEncryptedAmount(32) // 32 random bytes

// In production: Real encryption using:
// - AES-GCM for symmetric encryption
// - RSA/ECC for key exchange
// - Proper nonce/IV management
```

### PDA Derivation Helpers
```typescript
deriveOrderPda(orderBook, orderCount)
deriveEscrowPda(order)
deriveEscrowTokenAccountPda(order)
deriveCallbackAuthPda(orderBook, keeper)
```

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"

# Install Anchor
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

### Execute Tests
```bash
cd apps/anchor_program

# Build program first
anchor build

# Run all tests
anchor test

# Run with detailed output
anchor test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test suite
anchor test -- --test "place_order"
```

### Expected Output
```
🔧 Setting up test environment...

## 🔍 **Attack Vectors Tested**

1. **Insufficient Authorization**
   - ✅ Non-owner cannot cancel orders
   - ✅ Non-keeper cannot match orders

2. **State Manipulation**
   - ✅ Cannot cancel cancelled orders
   - ✅ Cannot cancel matched orders
   - ✅ Cannot match cancelled orders

3. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - ✅ Insufficient token balance
   - ✅ PDA collision prevention

4. **Input Validation**
   - ✅ Oversized cipher payloads rejected
   - ✅ Expired auth rejected

5. **Replay Attacks**
   - ✅ Nonce-based protection
   - ✅ Expiration timestamps

6. **Privilege Escalation**
   - ✅ Only authorized keepers can match
   - ✅ Only order book authority can create auth

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations**

### Test Environment
- Uses dummy encrypted data (not real encryption)
- Local validator (not mainnet conditions)
- Simplified token amounts (not production scale)

### Not Yet Tested
- [ ] Actual token settlement in match_orders
- [ ] Fee collection mechanism
- [ ] Order expiration
- [ ] Network failures/timeouts
- [ ] Concurrent transaction conflicts

   - Unhappy paths
   - Edge cases
   - Security scenarios

4. **Maintainable Code**
   - Helper functions for common operations
