# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Order Status Mismatch

## 🐛 The Bug

Orders were appearing as "Cancelled" even though they were successfully created!

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Status code mismatch between Smart Contract and Frontend:**

### Smart Contract (`lib.rs`):
```rust
ORDER_STATUS_ACTIVE = 1      ← Orders created with status 1
ORDER_STATUS_PARTIAL = 2
ORDER_STATUS_FILLED = 3
ORDER_STATUS_CANCELLED = 4
```

### Frontend (BEFORE fix):
```typescript
ACTIVE: 0                    ← Frontend expected 0 for active!
FILLED: 1
CANCELLED: 2                 
EXECUTED: 3
PARTIAL: 4
```

**Result:** Orders with `status = 1` were interpreted as "Cancelled" by the frontend!

## ✅ The Fix

Updated `apps/frontend/lib/program.ts`:

```typescript
export const ORDER_STATUS = {
  ACTIVE: 1,           // ✅ NOW MATCHES lib.rs
  PARTIAL: 2,          // ✅ NOW MATCHES lib.rs
  FILLED: 3,           // ✅ NOW MATCHES lib.rs
  CANCELLED: 4,        // ✅ NOW MATCHES lib.rs
  EXECUTED: 3,         // Same as FILLED
  MATCHED_PENDING: 5,  // NOW MATCHES lib.rs
} as const;
```

### Bot Status (already correct):
```typescript
// apps/settlement_bot/src/types.ts
export enum OrderStatus {
  ACTIVE = 1,         // ✅ Already correct!
  PARTIAL = 2,
  FILLED = 3,
  CANCELLED = 4,
  MATCHED_PENDING = 5,
}
```

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ All orders showed as "Cancelled"
- ❌ Bot couldn't see any active orders
- ❌ UI displayed incorrect status

### After Fix:
- ✅ Orders show correct status
- ✅ Bot can see active orders
- ✅ UI displays accurate information

---

## 📊 Verification

### Check Current Orders:
```bash
yarn view:orderbook
```

Should now show **3 orders with status "Active"** instead of "Cancelled"!

### Bot Should Now See Orders:
The bot will now detect the 3 existing orders on its next cycle (within 10 seconds).

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Watch bot logs** - It should detect the 3 active orders!
3. **Submit a new order** - It will now show as "Active"
4. **Submit a matching order** - Bot will match and settle!

## 📝 Lesson Learned

**Always ensure status codes match across:**
- ✅ Smart Contract (Rust)
- ✅ Frontend (TypeScript)
- ✅ Backend Bot (TypeScript)
- ✅ Documentation/Comments

**One source of truth:** The smart contract constants!
