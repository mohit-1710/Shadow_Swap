# Independent Setup Complete ✅

This folder (`ShadowSwap SPA Design/`) is now **completely independent** and can be deployed separately from the monorepo.

## What Changed

### 1. **Package Configuration**
- ✅ Updated `package.json` name from `my-v0-project` to `shadowswap-frontend`
- ✅ Removed monorepo workspace references
- ✅ Added ESLint dependencies directly (no workspace dependency)
- ✅ Removed `ts-node` (not needed for standalone)
- ✅ Added `engines` field for Node.js and pnpm version requirements

### 2. **Next.js Configuration**
- ✅ Removed turbopack root configuration (monorepo-specific)
- ✅ Simplified `next.config.mjs` to be standalone
- ✅ Added ESLint ignore during builds
- ✅ Kept webpack fallback config for native module warnings

### 3. **Imports Fixed**
- ✅ Fixed broken import in `hooks/useSwap.ts` (removed non-existent orcaPool import)
- ✅ Updated `components/TradeForm.tsx` to use `@/` path aliases consistently
- ✅ Fixed docs route to only look in local `docs/` folder (not parent directory)

### 4. **Documentation**
- ✅ Created standalone `README.md` with deployment instructions
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` for standalone project

### 5. **Dependencies**
- ✅ All dependencies are self-contained in `package.json`
- ✅ No references to parent workspace packages
- ✅ ESLint configured independently

## How to Deploy Independently

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd "ShadowSwap SPA Design"
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Copy `env.template` to `.env.local` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp env.template .env.local
```

Required variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORDER_BOOK`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`

### Step 3: Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Step 4: Deploy

You can now deploy this folder to any platform:

- **Vercel**: Connect the folder and set environment variables
- **Netlify**: Deploy with build command `pnpm build`
- **Custom Server**: Run `pnpm build && pnpm start`

## Verification Checklist

✅ No imports from `../` (parent directories)  
✅ No references to `packages/` or `apps/`  
✅ All dependencies in `package.json`  
✅ `next.config.mjs` is standalone  
✅ `tsconfig.json` uses local path aliases  
✅ `.gitignore` is complete  
✅ ESLint config is independent  

## Files You Can Safely Remove

If you want to further clean up, you can remove these files (they're not critical):
- Documentation markdown files (if you don't need them)
- `setup-wallet.sh` (if you don't need it)
- `package.json.bak` (backup file)

## What's Still Needed

- `lib/idl/shadow_swap.json` - **MUST EXIST** for the app to work
- Environment variables set before building
- All dependencies installed via `pnpm install`

## Notes

- The app will look for docs in a local `docs/` folder (optional)
- If the docs API route fails, it returns a helpful error message
- The `useSwap` hook is currently a placeholder - swap functionality should be implemented using Jupiter API endpoints

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY INDEPENDENT** - Ready for standalone deployment!
