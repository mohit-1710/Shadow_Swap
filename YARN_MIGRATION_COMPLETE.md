# Yarn Migration Complete ✅

The ShadowSwap project has been fully migrated to **Yarn** for dependency management across all workspaces.

---

## 📦 Workspaces Configured

The project uses **Yarn Workspaces** for monorepo management:

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "packageManager": "yarn@1.22.22"
}
```

### Active Workspaces:

```
ShadowSwap_Project/
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/              ✅ Yarn workspace
│   ├── settlement_bot/        ✅ Yarn workspace (UPDATED)
│   ├── anchor_program/        ⚙️  Anchor (uses cargo/anchor)
│   └── .shadow_swap_mxe_native_attempt/  (archived)
├── packages/
│   └── shared_types/          ✅ Yarn workspace
├── package.json               ✅ Root workspace config
└── yarn.lock                  ✅ Lockfile (432 KB)
```

## 🔄 What Changed

### 1. Settlement Bot (`apps/settlement_bot/`)
- ✅ Converted from npm to yarn
- ✅ Created `yarn.lock` (dependencies locked)
- ✅ Updated all documentation to use `yarn` commands
- ✅ Package scripts work with yarn

### 2. Documentation Updated
- ✅ `apps/settlement_bot/README.md` - All yarn commands
- ✅ `KEEPER_BOT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - All yarn commands
- ✅ `apps/anchor_program/QUICKSTART.md` - Yarn for dependencies

### 3. Root Workspace
- ✅ Already configured for yarn workspaces
- ✅ Root scripts use yarn workspace commands
- ✅ All workspaces share single `yarn.lock`

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Yarn Installation

```bash
# Verify yarn is installed
yarn --version
# Expected: 1.22.22 or higher

# Check workspace info
yarn workspaces info
```

### Verify All Workspaces

```bash
# From project root
yarn install

# Should see:
# [1/5] Validating package.json...
# [2/5] Resolving packages...
# [3/5] Fetching packages...
# [4/5] Linking dependencies...
# [5/5] Building fresh packages...
# ✨ Done
```

### Check Settlement Bot

```bash
cd apps/settlement_bot

# Dependencies installed
ls -la node_modules | head -5

# Yarn lock exists
ls -la yarn.lock

# Scripts work
yarn --help
```

---

## 📊 Workspace Dependencies

### Settlement Bot Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@solana/web3.js": "^1.87.6",
    "@coral-xyz/anchor": "^0.31.1",
    "@solana/spl-token": "^0.4.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
    "bn.js": "^5.2.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0",
    "@types/bn.js": "^5.1.5",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
    "ts-node-dev": "^2.0.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0"
  }
}
```

### Why Yarn?

✅ **Workspaces**: Monorepo management built-in  
✅ **Performance**: Faster than npm  
✅ **Deterministic**: Lockfile ensures consistency  
✅ **Offline**: Cached packages work offline  
✅ **Security**: Better audit capabilities  

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "yarn: command not found"

```bash
# Install yarn globally
npm install -g yarn

# Or use corepack (Node 16.10+)
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
```

### Dependency Issues

```bash
# Remove all node_modules
yarn clean

# Reinstall everything
yarn install

# If still issues, remove lockfile
rm yarn.lock
yarn install
```

### Workspace Not Found

```bash
# Check workspace configuration
cat package.json | grep -A 5 workspaces

# List all workspaces
yarn workspaces list
```

### Build Errors in Settlement Bot

```bash
cd apps/settlement_bot

# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist
yarn install
yarn build
```
